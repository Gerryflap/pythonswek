# Lines can start with:
#  # - comment
#  B - a new BinTree
#  S - a saved tree
#  C - continue from last line
# Followed by tokens:
#  +<N> - add N to the tree
#  -<N> - remove N from the tree
#  r<N> - rotate node N to the right
#  l<N> - rotate node N to the left
#  A    - show using the AsciiTreeVisualizer
#  %    - save the tree
#  #    - ignore rest of line
#  R<N> - do a big random test using N as seed
#  R    - do a big random test without a seed
#
#  After each line or error an ascii representation is printed.
#  After each add or remove operation a short representation is printed.
